<p>When I wrote about my first trip to the National Museum Publishing Seminar <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/06/26/steal-this-dichotomy-notes-from-the-national-museum-publishing-seminar-2012/">two years ago on this site</a>, I addressed the reasonably new task given to publishers of managing digital content without being any less of a print publisher.</p>
<p>Much as happened with the three times I attended Digital Book World and Tools of Change (my reviews are here for <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/01/25/its-the-audience-stupid-digital-book-world-2013/">DBW 2013</a>, <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/02/22/the-coming-hybrid-era-tools-of-change-2013-and-the-future-of-art-book-publishing/">TOC 2013</a>, and the <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/05/07/toc-rip/">later whacking of TOC</a>), conferences seem to have a set conversational style: even if the substance changes, it's more like Mad Libs than Socratic debate. If at my first NMPS I was new to the conference game, wide-eyed about the discussion over print and digital while still believing it was more a matter of workflow and willpower than technology and money, this time around I was more attuned to the willingness of institutions to experiment on their own terms, to find a style of publishing that matched their sense of mission.</p>
<p><a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/06/19/from-the-sub-basement-to-the-imperial-ballroom-digital-publishing-is-moving-on-up/">Greg Albers of Getty Publications detailed last week the excellent panel he moderated on digital publication technologies</a>, and the chart he presented and ensuing demonstrations by iBook Author maven Tina Henderson, Elisa Leshowitz of DAP/Artbook, and Edyta Lewicka of Potion design, is <a href="http://bit.ly/digpub101">a thorough primer</a> on many of the options available to get content out into digital spaces.</p>
<p>But if Greg's panel represents "EPUB 101," particular approaches to creating digital <em>publications</em>, there was no shortage of other platforms described to audiences over the two days of meetings. Among the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harvard Semitic Museum Egyptologist Peter der Manuelian in the opening keynote presented a <a href="http://giza3d.3ds.com/">3D rendering, complete with cheap red/blue glasses, of the Giza plateau</a> during its antiquity heyday, made by French company Dessault Systems.</li>
<li>Museum professionals from the <a title="The Met's One Met.Many Worlds" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/mymet/many-worlds" target="_blank">Met</a>, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, presented digital-first projects aimed at connecting directly with audiences through social and admissions programs.</li>
<li>A panel on guidebooks feating Scala Art Publishers, Smithsonian Books, and the Museum of Modern Art ran the gamut from walking tours to trade guides and a wide range of digital walkthroughs.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications">Met</a>, <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications">Guggenheim</a>, and <a href="http://www.moma.org/explore/publications">MoMA</a> detailed varied approaches to keeping backlists alive through digital means.</li>
<li>The final day's opening Pecha Kucha (yes, folks, <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/faq">it's a real thing</a>) slammed out five presentations in a series of 400-second blitzes. I had to miss that first morning session but heard a lot of interest about the Hirshhorn's multi-channel publication approach to their <a title="Ai Weiwei at the Hirshhorn" href="http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/ai-weiwei-according-to-what/#collection=tumblr-ai-weiwei-according-to-what" target="_blank">Ai Weiwei show</a> and the Albright-Knox Gallery's crowd-pubbed <a title="Anselm Kiefer at the Albright-Knox Gallery" href="http://www.albrightknox.org/exhibitions/exhibition:11-17-2013-anselm-kiefer-forget-me-not/" target="_blank">Anselm Kiefer catalogue</a> (links to their unique takes on publishing, sadly, are hard to find).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew. That's a lot of takes on digital publishing. Is that a good thing, part of the problem, solution, both, neither? Two years since my first NMPS, digital publishing <i>possibilities</i> are exploding, but print-raised publishers aren't explicitly in the possibilities business, at least not according to budget-conscious, admissions-concerned, merchandising-worried museum directors. Still, many of the museums presenting, such as the try-anything Guggenheim and the data-inhaling MoMA, are out there, collecting data on what works, seeing what gets downloaded, what makes money and what draws a big collective <em>meh</em>. So museum publishers are moving into try-mode, it's just that answers don't abound. Yet. Maybe 2016 in Chicago.</p>
<p>For me, an interesting meta-approach came from what was probably the least publishing-focused panel, on Creative Collaboration. Lynda Hartigan from the Peabody Essex Museum, <a title="David Small of Small Design Firm" href="http://www.davidsmall.com/" target="_blank">David Small of Small Design Firm</a>, and designer and Rhode Island School of Design professor <a title="Lucinda Hitchcock's website" href="http://lucindahitchcock.com/" target="_blank">Lucinda Hitchcock</a> discussed wide-open creative ideation that seem to be exactly of design-school and improv-comedy methods which would be laughed out of any curator-driven institution. And yet PEM is doing it in regular curator meetings--and before you say, yeah, PEM is small, the <a title="Small Design and American Wing wayfinding" href="http://www.davidsmall.com/portfolio/wayshowing-system/" target="_blank">Met worked with Small Design</a> on its massive <a title="Small Design and the Met's American Wing Period Rooms" href="http://www.davidsmall.com/portfolio/period-rooms-touchscreen/" target="_blank">reworking of its American Wing</a> a few years ago. For people who think that the process is as important as the product (okay, me on this site <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/08/17/is-our-method-driving-us-mad/">here</a> and <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/01/08/now-that-youve-launched/">here</a>), this is the kind of panel that really makes you think. And that's a good thing.</p>

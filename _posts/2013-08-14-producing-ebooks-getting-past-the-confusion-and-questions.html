<blockquote>"If you’re a publisher entering or engaged in the ebook publishing market, what is the best option for getting your ebooks produced? If you go online for guidance, posing the question in an ebook production and publishing discussion group, you will hear about solutions that work, and then how those same solutions don’t work. How some professional conversion tools are a great DIY option, and how no conversion tool can possibly produce sufficient quality. You’ll hear that an ebook that adheres to the layout fidelity of the print edition is a failure as an ebook while others bemoan the loss of the story as ebooks devolve into games. A seemingly innocuous question, “how do I do this,” will be met by a barrage of thinly veiled sales pitches (I’ll hold my hand up there) and often poorly informed opinion by those presenting themselves as “experts.” The result: confusion and many more questions." (Clynton Hunt, "<a href="http://publishingperspectives.com/2013/08/surveying-publisher-approaches-to-ebook-production/">Surveying Publisher Approaches to Ebook Production</a>")</p></blockquote>
<p>Clynton Hunt opened his post at <a href="tp://publishingperspectives.com/">Publishing Perspectives </a>with this very accurate lament.  To shed some light on the confusion and to provide the framework for a panel that he led at IDPF Digital Book 2013, Hunt conducted an informal survey of publishers' experiences with producing ebooks--from outsourcing to using internal staff as well as lessons learned along the way.  Last week he published the summary of the results at the link above. And while his survey focused on traditional publishing, we can see the very same challenges face museum publishers as well: increase staff in order to produce in-house or just outsource production? Which production or platform tools should you use? Hunt's post is a short summary of the survey, but well worth the read to see why more publishers are moving away from out-sourcing for greater efficiency.</p>
<p>On a related note, there have been a crop of new museum digital publishing projects that have hit the web or the app store this summer that illustrate just how varied a museum publisher's options are when producing a digital publication. Take a look at how each one uses a different platform and design to create a unique reading experience:</p>

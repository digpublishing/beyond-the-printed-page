<p>As Liz points to in a <a title="Seven publishing trends that will define 2013 from PandoDaily" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/01/04/seven-publishing-trends-that-will-define-2013-from-pandodaily/">previous post</a>, this is the time of year that predictions abound and reflecting on the past year can (and hopefully will) direct or redirect our goals for the New Year.  In “<a href="mailto:http://www.theliteraryplatform.com/2012/12/a-year-in-digital-publishing-and-what-to-expect-in-2013/%20">A Year in Digital Publishing and What to Expect in 2013</a>” at the Literary Platform, Jeff Norton points to one that I find equally inspiring and exciting:</p>
<p><strong> “Engaging the Reader: It’s now easy and fulfilling to engage with readers before a book is ever written, and authors and publishers will open up the creative process to include beta-readers the way Silicon Valley involves beta-testers in product development.”</strong></p>
<p>This is a prediction for the New Year…sort of.  A little more accurately, it’s a hoped-for prediction or even a call to action<em>.  I really like this one.</em>  First, because it isn’t the same digital publishing prediction that I’ve read in the twenty lists that have appeared in my inbox within the past few weeks.  Second (and more importantly), I have seen first hand just how useful and important beta-readers can be.</p>
<p>For the Art Institute of Chicago’s Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative Project (OSCI), we launched beta versions of our <a href="mailto:http://www.artic.edu/collections/books/online-scholarly-catalogues">19<sup>th</sup> Century Impressionist scholarly catalogues</a> over a year ago (November 2011) and three years before their official publication dates. <a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>  In approaching the design of our OSCI project, we considered both how we would deliver the scholarly content and what different types of content were appropriate in this new digital medium.  Therefore, it was important for us to test both the user experience of the technology as well as some fully fleshed out sample entries. The beta catalogues, including three artwork entries between two volumes, demonstrate most (<em>but not all</em>) of the technological vision as well as the type of content that will be available when the volumes are fully published online.</p>
<p>Why do a beta launch instead of just waiting and publishing the complete volumes?  First, we were (and arguably still are) at a very specific early moment in digital publishing that is exploring what it means to be a digital publication that is scholarly, illustrative, and interactive.  This was a new conception for the field, but also for our museum and the project’s team.  By gearing up for a beta launch, it forced us to go through the complete workflow to complete the three entries which later allowed us to analyze and revise our workflows for the remaining part project where needed.</p>
<p>Leading up to the launch, we put together a survey that asked about specific features, content, and interface that we were interested in receiving feedback about. We also set up an email account for direct feedback if readers wished to communicate in a less formal way than taking a survey.  And since we wanted to ensure that we received feedback from the publications’ intended audience (primarily scholars, conservators, publishers, technologists, librarians/archivists) we used targeted listservs to get the beta catalogues’ onto their computers.  Finally, we enabled Google Analytics in order to see more quantitative data, such as how long visitors were staying, percentage of new vs. returning visitors, and browser information.  Strategically planning on how one will receive and filter feedback is critical if a beta test is going to be informative.  Allowing beta readers to review and send reactions provide a few things for a project:</p>
<p>1. They can provide outside confirmation of various aspects of the content and interface as well as feedback about user interfaces that aren’t as friendly as you may have thought they were.  For museum projects that often take years to complete, positive feedback can provide (sometimes needed) encouragement and affirmation that you are heading in the right direction for your project.  If you receive negative feedback repeatedly about a specific issue, the great thing about beta testing is that you then have time to change and to tweak it in order to produce that best possible reading experience for when it is actually launched.</p>
<p>2. Responses can sometimes inspire you to stretch your vision a bit more.</p>
<p>3. Beta readers also provide a chance to create a relationship with the readers—even forging a sort-of partnership—as well a gaining a deeper understanding of their needs before the final publication.</p>
<p>The clinch pin of beta testing, though, is what you do with the data set of responses. After receiving a sizeable set of surveys and other reactions, we set about categorizing, analyzing, and discussing the responses.  And then, most importantly, we had to decide on next steps for the issues to which the beta readers drew our attention.</p>
<p>Within museums, we are often (and rightly) so concerned with presenting a flawless final product to the public. But using beta-readers/tester allows us to launch a great product but with the clear expectation that we can take users feedback to really hone and shape it and in the process form a relationship with the reader in order to produce a more vibrant and inventive reading experiences.  Is this for every project? Obviously, no.  But for new and original digital publishing projects, the need for it is much greater and the chance for learning from beta readers much higher.</p>
<p>Here is to a New Year and museums learning from beta readers!</p>

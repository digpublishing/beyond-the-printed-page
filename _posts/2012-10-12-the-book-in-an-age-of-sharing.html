<p><a title="Amazon link to Jeff Jarvis's Public Parts" href="http://www.amazon.com/Public-Parts-ebook/dp/B004W3FZ0Q" target="_blank">Public Parts</a>, by Jeff Jarvis, the founder of <a title="link to BuzzMachine.com" href="http://buzzmachine.com/" target="_blank">BuzzMachine</a>, is the kind of book that a print-mudgeon like me is supposed to hate on first read. A paean to über-sharability of all new media, it extols the natural networking built in to all post-Gutenberg-technology content. A book, Jarvis more or less says, just lays there, doing nothing. (And he admits the irony of these words appearing in a print book.)</p>
<p>Like all good print people, I took the bait and began sputtering "but" at every paragraph. I don't even belong to Facebook, so it's easy for me to deny that FB engenders any true sharing or real openness. And for Jarvis, he's not just pro-sharing. He believes that those who do not share are essentially withholding themselves, their knowledge, their wisdom, from the public sphere. In a strange way, it reminded me a bit of communism, the eastern-bloc kind, the primacy of the mass over the individual.</p>
<p>He talks a lot about publicness as a leveller of walls, of ivory towers, of silos, of demystifying the myth of perfection (or as Dan Sinker termed it at the National Museum Publishing Seminar in June, preciousness). To him, the definition of privacy to the FB-avoiders amounts to "that which is not creepy." And that's lame. Jarvis is more concerned with defining privacy and its abuse by its use rather than its gathering.</p>
<p>But, trying to be non-contrarian (which for me is being doubly-contrarian), I tried to see a broader point. Jarvis really isn't writing about the virtues of sharing versus privacy, but about solitariness versus networking, about singularities (silos?) versus connectivity. Which, when it comes down to it in my neck of the woods, is about the book versus the network. What does the book have to offer in a supposed age of connectivity, or, even more, an age of connection?</p>
<p>Digital content, Jarvis writes, quoting the definers of the <a title="University of Southern Denmark and the Gutenberg Parenthesis" href="http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Ilkm/Forskning/Forskningsprojekter/Gutenberg_projekt" target="_blank">Gutenberg parenthesis</a> (a fascinating read) "is infinitely changeable and flexible." I won't deny that. And I've worked on enough art books, slaved through enough busy summers getting our fall list published, to know that books are what they are. Transcendent? Maybe. Hopefully. But instantly networkable is not one of those things.</p>
<p>So what do we do with books? The answer, as always, comes back to content and context. We have to strive to make our books nodes of inspiration. Perhaps the tide of tech will sweep them away, though I don't think so. But we can set the bar higher, so that the content within them will be not just better, but better made. (And, while we're at it, better prepared, so that those uber-sharers will be able to do so.)</p>
<p>Jarvis's four points to being a good digital sharing citizen are (page 113):</p>
<ul>
<li>Be generous.</li>
<li>Share for a reason.</li>
<li>Use common standards.</li>
<li>Protect what's public.</li>
</ul>
<div>Not exactly the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, but it's hard to claim these are bad, depraved goals.</div>
<p>I recently put together a Best Practices document for use of InDesign within my department and for our freelance designers and other vendors. What was hatched in righteous anger ("no more hard returns to break lines, damn you all to hell!") has become, to my surprise, a point of conversation between me and our designers and typesetters. What I sent out were demands, what I got back was a network.</p>
<p>Cities, which are also intensely physical, are not just networks and not just artifacts. They are containers of rootedness, anchors of physical experience. They're not necessarily precious, but pyramidal, protean (dare I say, chthonic?). Pyramids are artifacts, but they're enduring and they're not dead because we don't let them be. The dead pyramids are the ones you don't see, because they haven't endured. A forgotten FB conversation is just as dead as a forgotten book.</p>
<p>Despite my print orientation, when I want a book to be used and reused, I get it digitally because it's so much easier to capture. I have a small apartment so I don't have a lot of space for new "p-books." That doesn't make print any less important, or any more precious. They're part of the conversation, which after all, is all that any of us should strive to be.</p>

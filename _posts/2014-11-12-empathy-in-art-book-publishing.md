Empathy as a concept has made increasing inroads into the content field. Dana Mitroff Silvers wrote an excellent piece on “design thinking,” a particular take on visitor experience that her firm spearheaded in their work for the SFMoMA relaunch and have taken it on the road, as it were. (The article has links to several other interesting articles on empathy as part of museum visitor experience, targeting the needs of visitors as individuals.)

Empathy as a general idea was the subject of a back and forth about its usefulness in the New Yorker with a response in the Huffington Post. Museums struggling to increase membership and audience engagement are asking questions and trying to find personas in their audiences (the Met’s head of merchandising Jo Prosser has made the excellent point that one museum visitor can adopt many personas, even in a single visit).

Self-publishers have long been advised to understand their audiences—who is your reader? What do they read? What do they think? (The exercises in creating idealized readers can run close to serial-killer profiles, though.) In the digital era, publishers are advised to test their findings by changing links, updating prices, seeing reaction to particular social feeds, etc. That’s a lot of work on top of creating product.

For art museum publishers used to working in print, the need to work for both the institutional and the curatorial vision can create an audience dilemma—how to do you reach scholarly and general audiences with the same publication at the same time? This smacks of the old print versus digital dichotomy, never mind the timeworn museum loyal-old-versus-hot-new-audience dichotomy, from which follows the assumption that print is meant for traditional audiences while digital meant for millennials. The ensuing danger is confirmation bias, where research validates what you already believe. The result is silofication, as print publishers assume that digital will handle new audiences exclusively (while digital publishers probably aren’t losing sleep about print).

The added wild card is audience behavior. New devices and apps affect market trends (have tablets already lost their mojo?) and vice versa. The Met’s new app (shameless plug, and I didn’t even work on it) isn’t a whiz-bang tablet experience but a handy guide that works perfectly on the iPhone. Audience behavior affects print in more ways than just general preferences—remember how airlines’ charging for any checked baggage added a punitive tax to the purchase of heavy art books while on vacation?

This is where the idea of _multiple_ personas can help. Who says that the person visiting the museum and using their phone as an audioguide (the Met app does audio stops) isn’t also an ideal customer for the beautiful print book? What about some of the content of the book? Can a mix of print and digital (and the latter as a mix of ebook and online, maybe even PDF) meet the individual needs of some museum visitors?

The answer starts with research. No one wants to drown our visitors in surveys, but the experience of self-publishers who have been told to build communities of their readers is worth examining. Publishers, both print and digital, need to create those kinds of communities and be ready to reach many audiences with many formats. Like empathy and visitor experience, publishing has to be more than just audience research; it has to take the individual user/reader/visitor into account. We’ve heard about hacking the museum, but perhaps we museum publishers need to hack our audiences back. After all, empathy is acknowledging the experience of the _other_ and learning to experience it ourselves from their point of view.

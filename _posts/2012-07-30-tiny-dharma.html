<p>New York’s <a title="Rubin Museum of Art" href="http://http://www.rmanyc.org/" target="_blank">Rubin Museum of Art</a> premiered a film Wednesday night about the late language scholar E. Gene Smith’s decades-long project to preserve Tibetan cultural and religious documents in the continuing aftermath of the Chinese takeover in 1959. His efforts used whatever technologies were available at the time, starting with photocopying, reprinting, and, eventually scanning, to capture the texts existing only on wooden printing blocks and delicate pages that war, cultural oppression, and even just time would ultimately destroy.</p>
<p>Dafna Yachin’s film <a title="film Digital Dharma" href="http://digitaldharma.com/" target="_blank">Digital Dharma</a> combines interviews and documentary footage and subtle animation to tell Smith's story. By the time of Smith’s death in late 2010, over 7 million pages of ancient texts of Tibet’s Buddhist heritage had been digitally preserved, and much of it, in poignant scenes throughout the film, given back to the monasteries in Tibet and the Tibetan diaspora in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and elsewhere. If there’s a better advert for the enlightened possibilities of digital preservation than a lama placing a hard drive on his head in an expression of honor and blessing, I’m not aware of it.</p>
<p>It all struck a chord for me, as someone who's not only personally interested in the subject matter but who also works in the publication of cultural knowledge (with considerably less risk than Smith and the many monks and Tibetans who braved mountain passes to smuggle texts out). Here, technology has allowed the content not just to reach a large audience, but to be delivered back to the people whose lineage has been defined by that very text. The audience at the museum was uneasy when the film ended with footage from Chengdu, China, where Smith’s dream of setting up a library of rescued Tibetan texts, delayed by the Tibetan riots of 2008, was ultimately realized in 2011. After all, it's easy to think Smith naive for delivering this cultural heritage back to the government responsible for its peril. (Smith was adamant in an interview in the film that Tibetan independence was out of the question.) But, as Janet Gyatso, Hershey Professor in Buddhist Studies in the Divinity School at Harvard University, said to close the film, now, thanks to Smith, all of it is preserved digitally. It's good.</p>
<p>At the Q&amp;A after the film, Jeff Wallman, who’s been involved in the technical side of Smith’s mission for the past decade, showed off a palm-sized hard drive to the audience, with 16,000 volumes of Buddhist text on it. Everyone just went, <em>whoa</em>. That, to me, was the takeaway. It’s not just preservation but miniaturization. Another great scene in the film was Smith handing a different lama at a remote monastery a thumb drive with sacred texts, to wear like an amulet in a pouch around his neck. It puts the preservation of content--in this case, one essential to a still very-much-living cultural and religious tradition--in context. Teachers and religious figures alike can access multiple commentaries at the same time, something impossible with the heavy, delicate piles of manuscripts, and in areas where the only cloud is the one shrouding the landscape.</p>
<p>The film will be showing Wednesdays at the Rubin Museum through September 5, and should be available on DVD after that.</p>

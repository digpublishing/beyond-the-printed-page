<p>In early versions of Apple's iBooks app, your Library of titles, and the Store where you could buy new titles were presented as two sides of the same coin (or skeuomorphic wood-paneled bookcase) that you flipped between. And even though you didn't leave the app between buying and reading books, you were either in the Library or in the Store, but never both. When Apple upgraded iBooks along with the release of iOS 7 last year, the line between Store and Library were blurred. Now, when you're in the Library, links to the Store appear along the bottom of the screen, there is no real toggling back and forth. This makes sense. From both Apple's business perspective and the Reader's user experience perspective it makes sense to me that the more seamless this relationship between buying and reading, the better. What's caught my attention recently though is the specifics of those Store links at the bottom of my Library page. They are: Featured, NYTimes, Top Charts, and Top Authors.</p>

<p>So, what if I'm in my Library of e-books and I get a hankering to read Don DeLillo's 1985 National Book Award winner, <a title="Wikipedia -- White Noise (novel)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_%28novel%29" target="_blank"><em>White Noise</em></a>—as I often do—which of Apple's provided store links should I click on? Your answer might be Search, but you'll note, there is no search link. You might then think of looking in the fiction section, but there is no list of common book Categories that would list fiction. Nor is there a link to award-winning books, or classic literature that might offer a path. Instead we are forced to choose between four options that are basically just variations on the same thing: bestsellers.</p>
<p>Of course in the end, Search, Categories, and Award-Winners are all available options for locating tiles in the iBooks store, but they're all accessed only by passing through one of the four bestseller links we are first presented with. What does this approach say about Apple's position in relation to the book? By which I mean, not the singular book, but to capital-B Books, and Literature and Culture, etc…  Is Apple selling books, or is it only selling bestselling books? What does it mean to us as publishers that we are putting so much attention into creating books for this particular vendor and their seductively beautiful iProducts, when it seems the only winners there are the ones already winning? What does this mean for the digital art books that museums and art publishers are creating in Fixed Layout EPUB, reflowable EPUB3 or iBooksAuthor formats and selling through the iBooks Store? How many of these are destined for one of these bestseller categories?</p>
<p>While Apple and the iPad should continue to be part of our digital publishing efforts, we need to be thoughtful about what we are getting into. The most fundamental questions we have been asking ourselves as publishers for decades are as important today as they ever have been: What formats are we publishing? What stores will sell them? How will our audiences find them?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.holartbooks.com/fromabove"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3026" title="readergraphic" alt="" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/readergraphic-205x300.png" width="205" height="300" /></a>In the spring of 2013, before I came to the Getty, I did a special e-book publication for the Phoenix Art Museum and their latest photography exhibition, <em><a title="&quot;From Above&quot; at the Phoenix Art Musuem" href="http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/fromabove" target="_blank">From Above: Aerial Photography from the Center for Creative Photography</a></em>. Like with museum exhibitions anywhere, in the course of creating the show an amazing trove of often disparately held materials were created: Exhibition checklists with digital images and information on each work in the show; object wall labels; introductory wall text; brochure and website text; reading lists; artist bios; and on and on. In something of a publishing experiment, I worked with curator Rebecca Senf to compile all these materials into an exhibition e-book. Because all the materials had already been created and approved, creating the e-book was more a matter of simple compilation and formatting, than of all the unique work and development that goes into a full exhibition catalogue. The whole thing took about 30 hours of work to create.</p>
<p>Though we certainly could have done more, keeping to our bootstrap methodology we did little in the way of additional work to market or distribute the publication. This was more about answering the question of what a super-minimal digital exhibition publication process could look like, and what use it might serve. At the least we thought it would serve as a nice, contained archive of all those ephemeral materials that usually disappear with the closing of a show like this, even in larger shows that have their own printed exhibition catalogues.</p>
<p>The show ran from May 4 to September 22, 2013, and the e-book was available to anyone for free download online. There was a scannable link to it in the exhibition gallery, as well as on the exhibition website; and the curator also sent a link to her growing list of the museum and area photo supporters.</p>
<p>By the end of the exhibition, about 800 people downloaded the e-book. That seems like a quite respectable number to me, especially given the small amount of investment—in time or money—made in making the publication happen. And given our minimal approach, there is certainly room for growth here. More download links and signage could have been placed in other areas of the museum like the shop and information desk. A brief workshop on the e-book download and usage could have been done to educate and empower the museum's staff and docents. Promotion of the e-book could have been further integrated into and elaborated upon in the exhibition press materials. There are many more ways I think we could have gotten that download number higher, and most are super easy and low cost.</p>
<p>The e-book is <a href="http://www.holartbooks.com/fromabove" target="_blank">still available for download</a>, and below are the rest of the download stats, unvarnished and without further analysis. Enjoy!</p>

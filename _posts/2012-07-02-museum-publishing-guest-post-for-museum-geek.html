<p><a title="@shineslike on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/shineslike" target="_blank">Suse Cairns</a>, a super energetic and smart PhD student in Australia, manages the thought-provoking <a title="museum geek" href="http://museumgeek.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">museum geek blog</a>, which she uses as a forum to think through issues around museums, technology and ideas, to join the debate about the future of museums, and connect with others in the field.</p>
<p>Intrigued by the tweets coming out of the National Museum Publishing Seminar, Suse asked if I would do a guest post for the blog. Maybe I was inspired by <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/members/jmohan/" target="_blank">Joseph Mohan's</a> <a title="Punk Publishing at the Museum" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/06/24/punk-publishing-at-the-museum/">music-centered post</a> or  it just made sense to embrace a collaboration theme, because it seemed like the best format for the post would be to co-author it with my former music band mates <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/members/k8ereilly/">Katie Reilly</a>, Head of Publications at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/members/sguernsey/">Sarah Guernsey</a>, Director of Publications at the Art Institute of Chicago both of whom also participated in the conference.</p>
<p>Over the course of the conference, the three of us had several great conversations about the future of museum publishing. Read our take on creative collaboration as a publishing model in <a title="Making the Museum Publishing Band" href="http://museumgeek.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/guest-post-making-the-museum-publishing-band/" target="_blank">Making the Museum Publishing Band</a>. As a bonus, the post includes a photo of the band in action.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Getty Foundation's Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative reached an important milestone this past year for many of the museums who participated in it: completion! (For more information about OSCI, see the Getty Foundation's <a href="http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/osci/index.html">OSCI page</a>.) And while I’ve personally been steeped in the Art Institute of </span>Chicago's<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> OSCI production for the past 3 years, it’s been refreshing this past month to take a step back and to survey the breadth—both in subject matter and presentation—of the scholarly collection catalogues that are now available from this group </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">of museums.  Going through each collection catalogue—from the Walker’s on performance art and SAM’s on Chinese painting—it’s interesting to start taking stock of how different online scholarly collection catalogues can be addressed and then realized. These differences range from the philosophical questions of what is a page, to the practical of how does a digital publication fit within a museum’s online collections presence, to the design of how immersive, book-like or database-like the material is presented as well as to the more technical questions of how to actually make it all come together.  To finish the summer off, I’d encourage readers to “flip through” the catalogues that have been produced from this endeavor thus far...</span></p>

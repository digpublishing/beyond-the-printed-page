<p><strong>What does authorship mean in the digital age?</strong> The recommended read, “<a href="http://www.booksonline.iospress.nl/Content/View.aspx?piid=30619">Evolving Definitions of Authorship in Ebook Design</a>,” a paper presented at the <a href="http://www.elpub.net/Elpub_2012/Main_Page.html">16<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Electric Publishing</a> in Guimaraes, Portugal by Celeste Martin and Jonathan Aitken, posits the question, “If the organization of the reader/user experience informs understanding of content, then does the designer rightfully claim a role as author?”<a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/07/16/defining-authorship-in-digital-publications/screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-12-44-28-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-640"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-640" title="Screen shot 2012-07-16 at 12.44.28 PM" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-12.44.28-PM.png" alt="" width="217" height="149" /></a></p>
<p>Now, the first reaction you may experience is, “Well, of course not.”  After all, designers and editors have always been involved in the process of creating a printed book. Font sizes, scripts, print layout, ordering of chapters, etc. are all deliberate decisions that impact how the book effectively communicates to the reader.  Credit to those individuals or departments are due, but they are not conferred the title "author" or "contributor."</p>
<p>But a simple 'no' to this question isn't a satisfying answer since two other questions hover closely in the background and are implicit in its posing:  in a new medium—ebooks and other online publications—are these design decisions <em>heighten</em> or <em>fundamentally different </em>than in print as to warrant the "designers" (whether they reside in Publications, Technology or Graphic Design) the label of authors? And furthermore, when is it more important “how texts are <em>used” </em>rather than “what they mean?”<a title="" href="#_edn2">[1]</a></p>
<p>Compellingly, Martin and Aitken assert that the content in ebooks are essentially "re-conceive[d]" by the designer as an "experimental space" and as a result become "part of the content, extending the writing and realizing the 'Text.'"<a title="" href="#_edn1">[2]</a>  Similarly when you speak to someone, they defer meaning from your speech in three ways: 55% from body language, 38% from tone of voice, and only 7% from the actual words that you say [i.e. your content].  The composition of the words provides the primary message.  But everything that surrounds the words are arguably just as important. The pivotal--or complete--content is then the text plus the "packaging."  Stripped of the ebook designer's touch, the text would no longer be the same as when presented as a digital publication.</p>
<p>Of course every publication is unique with varying degrees of enhancement and non-writer input.  But with such organizations and institutions as <a href="http://canopycanopycanopy.com/">Triple Canopy</a> and the Art Institute of Chicago already including their technology teams as authors or contributors for their online publications, are we seeing a new definition of author and collaboration emerge within digital publishing? Is a paradigm shift occurring as to how we define 'author'?</p>

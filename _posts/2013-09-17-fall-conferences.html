<p>Here in Chicago, the wind is starting to get chillier and the days are getting shorter, heralding that autumn is going to soon be upon us.  And with the arrival of fall comes a number of conferences. Presentations like "Print to Digital, Digital First, Simultaneous Publishing--What's Your Strategy?" will at the <em>Publishing Conference and Expo</em> in New York next week. And in October, hear talks like "Digital Books and dotRights" at <em>Books in Browsers</em> in San Francisco.  If you are attending a conference or presentation this coming season, let us know your reaction and takeaways. The Bliki community would love to hear about it!</p>

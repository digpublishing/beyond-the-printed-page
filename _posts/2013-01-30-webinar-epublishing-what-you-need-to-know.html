Stephen Hoban is the Associate Director for Publishing at the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications">Solomon R. Guggenheim, NY</a>. In consultation with multiple museum departments, Stephen has overseen the Guggenheim’s initiatives into digital publishing, launching the first exhibition catalogue e-book for <em>Maurizio Cattelan: All</em> in 2011. Tina Henderson is a freelance designer/production artist of books, ebooks, and book apps. She writes about tips and eProduction trends for her <a href="http://tinahenderson.com/blog/">blog</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/tinahender">twitter</a> and has even contributed to the <a title="Practical Matters: Digital Publishing Tools for Art Book Publishers" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/10/04/practical-matters-digital-publishing-tools-for-art-book-publishers/">Bliki</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to cover a lot of ground in this 2 ½ hour workshop—museum publishing strategy, the vocabulary of ePublication, a detailed rundown of the popular formats and authoring environments such as iBooks Author and Adobe DPS, distribution strategy, and trends to watch.</p>

<p>I continue to be <a title="Sitting in Pictures of Chairs: Digital Reading and Adobe" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/07/10/sitting-in-pictures-of-chairs-digital-reading-and-adobe/">critical</a> of Adobe DPS and iBooks Author as routes to digital publishing, but I readily acknowledge their utility for, and growing popularity among, artists and visual art publishers. Even as little as six months ago, there were so few of these things out that you could get attention for your digital publication simply for having done it. The novelty of the format was a story in itself. No longer. There are now enough being done that these e-books are going back to being judged for what they are—books. Books that, just like their print counterparts, must capture interest and engage their readers on the merits of their content and design.<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> Unfortunately, many of the Adobe DPS and iBooks Author publications I've been asked to look at don't do this, but</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> I think I can offer a few tips. </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I hope you'll find them useful.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Don't add in fancy multimedia features just because you can</strong>. Make sure they make sense for what you're trying to say.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Avoid giving written directions</strong> on what a reader should do, or how they should read. This is often a result of having too many different multimedia features (see above note), or odd navigation structures (see below note), but there are also some design things that can be done to prompt a reader's action without sentence after sentence of written instruction. More than page layout design, consider digital publishing an exercise in user experience design (UX). Read up on this.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Consider limiting the scope of the content</strong> in order to make a more immersive and cohesive reading experience. It's much easier to get lost in a digital book (not lost as in immersed, but lost as in misguided), especially with navigation systems like the ones Adobe DPS and iBooks Author provides. Allow for this by making sure that each random path through the book feels like a satisfying one.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Avoid page layouts, think about screen layouts instead.</strong> The longer vertically scrolling sections of an Adobe DPS book, and to a lesser extent the horizontal sections of iBooks Author, are essentially created with individual pages stitched together, but that doesn't mean each section should be in a page-like layout, they need to flow.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Remember that publishing with these tools limits your audience to owners of essentially a single device, beautiful though that device is. How will you share it with others? <strong>Consider making a secondary version to give your book/app a life and purpose beyond the one screen.</strong> Perhaps a web version, even if only with limited functionality, or a PDF version for that matter. </span></li>
</ul>

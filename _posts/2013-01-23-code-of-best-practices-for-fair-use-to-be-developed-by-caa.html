<p style="text-align: left;">The College Art Association announced last week that it has received an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant in order "to develop, publish, and disseminate a code of best practices for fair use in the creation and curation of artworks and scholarly publishing in the visual arts."  For illustration-heavy digital books where securing rights can be quite costly and sometimes problematic, this looks to be a welcome direction for the field.  Read more about the awarded grant and the project as a whole <a href="http://www.collegeart.org/news/2013/01/14/caa-receives-mellon-grant-for-fair-use-project/">here.</a></p>

<p>I didn't know what to expect at this year's College Art Association Annual Conference in New York. Not because I've never attended the yearly gathering, but because I feel like the art world has lately been preoccupied in virulent banter over how commercialism and money is running (and ruining, depending who you ask) art. But I didn't feel schism when I ascended the packed escalators at the Hilton New York , steps away from the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Over a few days, the CAA conference manages pack in hundreds of sessions with art historians, artists and art professionals discussing everything from new conservation practices to trends in video art from 1970 to present. My favorite panel, the ARTspace-sponsored "Pieces and Bits: Hybrid Art that Combines Physical Froms with Internet Components," surprised me and I almost missed it to attend "Feminism Meets the Big Exhibition: 2005 Onwards." I snuck into the dark meeting hall just in time to hear Brad Troemel of the <a href="http://thejogging.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Jogging</a> discuss his recent works, which, in his words, seek to "engage the potential of the digital world in the physical." Troemel presented images of his BFA project, in which he photographed the blank walls of his school's gallery and inserted images of other people's work which he sourced over email. With the Jogging, Troemel has linked to an Etsy page in an effort to sell his works, which are images of fantastical objects created from the amalgamations of images he finds on the Internet (for example, <a href="http://bradtroemel.com/index.php/project/etsy/" target="_blank">a taco pierced by a large lock</a>). The images become prints when someone purchases one off the Etsy, thus allowing, as Troemel explained, the free market to decide what images becomes physical, and which ones are destined to remain virtual forever.</p>
<p>After Troemel, Robert Hult presented Klaus.net, the virtual arm of his gallery, <a href="http://www.klausgallery.com/" target="_blank">Klaus Von Nichtssagend Gallery</a> (located in Manhattan, on the Lower East Side). A few years ago, when the Internet still felt like the "wild west," Hult and his co-owners started commissioning and selling online-only art on Klaus.net. Hult explained how he and his colleagues (with the help of a curator that they enlisted) editioned early forms of internet art (or purely digital art) and established a collectorship for the discipline. Klaus.net attracted a significant amount of press when it first launched--the project was written about in Art in American and L Magazine--but Hult and his colleagues were disappointed that journalists and critics were almost exclusively interested in how they were valuing and commercializing pieces instead of the work itself. Thus, Hult explained, Klaus.net was exploring and  invading the realm of e-books via amazon and ibooks. They find the ebook "democratic" and "autonomous" because artists can create whatever they'd like within the easily-attainable format.  Klaus_ebooks was to launch Friday or Saturday (February 15 or 16), and <a href="http://www.klausgallery.net/ebooks" target="_blank">would offer books (artworks)  for about $2.99 each</a>.</p>
<p>Klaus_ebooks is an exciting venture, not because it belongs to a parent gallery looking to publish a book, but because Hult and his colleagues see ebooks as a format and venue for internet artists to make work that's particular to the digital world which can also be viably collected by a mainstream audience. It seems that Hult and his colleagues perceived of ebooks not in the simple sense of traditional books moved to digital format, but as a platform for innovation and collectorship with a more egalitarian focus.</p>
<p>Hult, Troemel and their co-panelists were refreshing, and not just because they have invigorating ideas about art making and collectorship. They had perceptible senses of humor, and spoke with their audience instead of simply reading a paper. They weren't bored with their talk, but seemed truly enthusiastic about their work and sharing if with others. Troemel and Hult are both making work within the confines of a commercial sphere, and yet both are reinventing the idea of collectorship through digital means.</p>

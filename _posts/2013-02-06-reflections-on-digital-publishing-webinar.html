<p>First, I’d like to thank <a href="http://mcnpro.org/" target="_blank">MCN Pro</a> for hosting the webinar, and the presenters, <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/members/eneely/" target="_blank">Liz</a>, Stephen and <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/members/tina/" target="_blank">Tina</a>. I think they all did a great job of demystifying some of the nuts and bolts of e-publishing, from file formats to distribution and even sales. If all you ever read is the hype coming from Apple and Adobe, it’s easy to get the impression that everybody is doing amazing things with their tools and if you’re not, then you must be behind the curve. So, it’s great to get a reality check of what people are actually doing.</p>
<p>A quick word on my perspective: I don’t work for a museum . . . I’m an independent contractor, like Tina, who does typesetting and other production work for several museums and book designers. I’ve worked on many exhibit catalogs and other “coffee table” books over the past 25 years, and the one thing that my projects all have in common is that I have been lucky enough to work with with very talented book designers who care deeply about high-quality typography and other production values.</p>
<p>I’ve been paying close attention to the development in ePubs, iBooks Author, and iPad Apps, looking for an opportunity to create something in one of these formats for one of my museum clients. But as I see it, it’s not that the glacier-like museums aren’t ready for epublishing; it’s more that epublishing has not been ready for the museums.</p>
<p>As far as the coffee-table exhibit catalogs are concerned, it seems to me that a person buys this as a souvenir of a visit to a museum, or because they love a particular artist’s work. As Keats says, “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” You can pick it up, flip through the pages and say, “I saw that painting in person.” Or look at sketches that you didn’t get to see in the museum, and read all the background info that you didn’t get at the exhibit. There is a great pleasure to be had from the book — holding it, displaying it, even buying it, you feel like you are getting something for your $69.95. It is heavy, it won’t become obsolete in 6 months, and it works without electricity. I may be wrong, but I don’t think people who buy an app or an ePub are going to feel the same sense of value and pride of ownership and the desire to flip through it weeks or months after the exhibition.</p>
<p>Even for younger readers who consume 100% of their information digitally, I don’t think an ebook can give the customer the kind of ownership experience that a printed book does. At least for now, I just don’t think ebooks are good enough to even try to compete with these kinds of books.</p>
<p>I don’t mind saying that when it comes to museum publications, I’m a snob. I want books to be nicely designed and printed on expensive paper with a good binding. I want it to reflect the brand identity of the institution, and its mission.</p>
<p>Coffee table books are the Cadillacs (BMW’s? Lexuses?) of book publishing. This makes sense because most museums are all about the highest forms of human expression in a given genre. Now that we have new digital media platforms, I think the museums should continue to create products that represent the highest design and production values available on these new platforms. From what I’ve seen so far, most ePubs are more the equivalent of airport romance novels than coffee table books, and the format is suited to them because its limitations on design and typography don’t matter to the text-only market. We don’t make mass-market exhibit catalogs, so why make mass-market museum ePubs?</p>

<p>What I envision are apps for iPads and other devices that have been rethought entirely to take advantage of the platform, just as books are designed to take advantage of paper and ink. I mentioned the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elements-visual-exploration/id364147847?mt=8" target="_blank">Elements</a> app yesterday - that is a great example. I have owned that for a year and still love playing with it. If the app is designed for the platform, it will be plenty interactive enough to get through Apple’s gatekeepers. It’s only when someone tries to make an app that is really more like a book with a few extras in it that there is a problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won’t be cheap to produce. It will require new photography, video, programming, writing, editing, rights acquisition . . . but it is an exciting opportunity. Someone will do one that is fabulous, and then everybody will be trying to catch up, once they discover that there is a market. One advantage I do see for digital over print is that one can easily make a “light” version of an app that is either free or inexpensive. You can offer different versions of the same product at different price points. Another huge advantage is that you can sell it to people all over the world instantly.</p>
<p>In short, my takeaway from yesterday’s webinar is that making museum publications with iBooks Author might be an OK stopgap for now, but it really is a compromise in quality and the experience of ownership suffers in comparison to a coffee table book. When an app is sitting on your iPad, nobody sees it and it’s easy to forget you even own it. So, if we’re going to create digital publications, I think we need to make something completely different; something that really takes advantage of what digital publications can do that books cannot. It has to be highly interactive, beautifully made, and cool enough to make people want to use it over and over.</p>
<p>I’m very curious to hear what others think about this.</p>

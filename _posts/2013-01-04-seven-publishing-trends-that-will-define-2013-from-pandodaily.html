<p>Though it's an brief overview aimed at overall publishing trends, I found it to be a relevant synthesis of what our museum readers, scholars and audiences may be expecting from us as we forge paths in museum digital publishing. Of particular interest are the interestingly dichotomous trends of the lean –  micro- or subcompact publishing – and the weighty – resource-intensive multimedia publishing. Both of these trends have a place in museum publishing portfolios. We've always produced different types of publications from the scholarly to the ephemeral. Will it be a challenge to maintain these different velocities moving forward?</p>

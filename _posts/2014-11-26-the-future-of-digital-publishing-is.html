<p>Web books, html5 books, web apps, open ebooks—whatever you call them, I am a <a title="SlideShare: Web Books NMPS Talk" href="http://www.slideshare.net/geealbers/web-books-web-books-the-future-of-digital-publishing-is-open" target="_blank">proponent of these approaches</a> to digital publishing and I've been happy to see they are gaining support in <a title="Books in Browsers V: A digital publishing nerd’s heaven" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/10/31/books-in-browsers-v-a-digital-publishing-nerds-heaven/">other places</a> as well. Still, the big question remains: <strong>What do they look like, and how might we make them?</strong></p>
<p>At the <a title="Museum Computer Network" href="http://mcn.edu/" target="_blank">Museum Computer Network</a> conference this year, I and two other panelists sought some answers for the field. After a quick overview of digital publishing today, we broke the session into three parts: I spoke about Git, <strong><a title="Getty Publications on GitHub" href="https://github.com/gettypubs" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong> (<a title="YouTube, The Future of Digital Publishing, 09:50" href="http://youtu.be/SA8iww30pUI?t=9m50s" target="_blank">09:50</a>) and open source software as an ad hoc and distributed approach to digital publication; Curtis Fletcher spoke about <strong><a title="Scalar" href="http://scalar.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Scalar</a></strong> (<a title="YouTube, The Future of Digital Publishing, 29:57" href="http://youtu.be/SA8iww30pUI?t=29m507" target="_blank">29:57</a>) as one of the leading examples of the packaged, open authoring and publishing platforms available today; and to demonstrate the possibilities of fully customized from-scratch web publications, Avery Swartz spoke about the rapidly growing collection of online books at the heart of the <strong><a title="Art Canada Institute / L’Institut de l’art canadien" href="http://www.aci-iac.ca/" target="_blank">Art Canada Institute</a></strong> (<a title="YouTube, The Future of Digital Publishing, 54:36" href="http://youtu.be/SA8iww30pUI?t=54m36s" target="_blank">54:36</a>). The full audio synched with the slides is embedded below and available on YouTube.</p>

<p>I say at some point in the talk that I enjoyed putting these panels together to learn about the panelists' projects for myself, as much as for the audience to do so. And that was definitely the case here. Some standout points for me were that Scalar includes built-in direct connections to a number of different image repositories, including the Getty's collection, from which authors can import images directly and with complete metadata and caption information while also still maintaining a link to the original source (!); and I loved that Avery shared that even only a few years into the ACI project, they'd already had some lessons learned including a preference for responsive web design and the value of more extensive user testing.</p>
<p>All in all a very positive session, a good sign of things to come, and a great opportunity to learn more about what's going on in digital publishing and some of the people making it happen!</p>

<p><strong>“What has been accomplished and what remains to be done?”</strong>  Alan Jacobs, English professor and writer for the <em>the Atlantic</em>, asks this question in his brief report about the current technological development of ebook devices in, “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/e-reading-a-midterm-progress-report/260478/">E-Reading: A Midterm Progress Repor</a>t.”  In the face of the 5 year anniversary of first Kindle's debut and two years from the first iPad, Jacob highlights some of the best strides that have occurred thus far while pointing out where there is still room for much improvement: uninspiring layouts, too many typos and errors, and cumbersome screen glare.  But the most crucial area that is still lacking in e-reading--in Jacob's opinion--is “readers’ <em>interactions</em> with books.” Jacob laments that how a reader can annotate—highlight, write in the margins, etc.—oftentimes isn’t even a part of the discussion when it needs to be at the forefront.</p>
<p>I found myself wanting to cheer Jacobs on in agreement.  As a I die-hard margin writer for pretty much any book I read, being able to talk back to the text is not only important in the moment of reading (keeps me focused and engaged), but also as a record of how a particular book struck me (or maybe didn't) at a very specific moment in life.  I recently re-read a book that I read for the first time 10 years ago and was amazed at how often I disagreed with my original reactions and thoughts in the margins.</p>
<p>BUT in the midst of my remembering how much I enjoy writing in books, I realized that there is one group of books that I don't usually personally annotate: books I buy at museums.  The pages are too beautiful, and more often than not, the books are somewhat of a souvenir or the proverbial coffee table book, and usually does cost more. Perhaps, then, the question as to what has been accomplished and what remains to be done is different for museums than the wider publishing industry. Or perhaps the better question is conceptually breaking down and separating the types of publishing museums do and then ask the question.  For scholarly publishing produced by museums, what are the accomplishments and for what can we still be striding?  For guidebooks, what have been successful examples of digital publishing? For coffee table-esque digital books, what  should be imitated and what should perhaps be rethought?</p>

<p>These questions are by no means exclusive to one another.  You can be all three (or just one or two): subscriber, member and contributor.  But each category has its own simple set of needs.  First, if you would like to receive the latest blog posts and email alerts in your inbox as soon as they are published, enter your email address in the "Subscribe" box along the right-hand side.  Second, to join the community and the conversation, <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/about/register-as-a-bliki-contributor/">create an account for the Bliki</a>.  And finally, we would love to hear from you--leave a comment or submit a post!</p>

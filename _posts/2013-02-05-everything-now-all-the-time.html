<p>That’s what our audience wants.</p>
<p>I don’t mean each individual member of our museum-going audience, but the aggregate of all of them, real or potential, recently-attended or never-attended or even now-in-the-building or visiting-the-website.</p>
<p>While many of our institutions are specialized, we all have more on display than any individual visited might expect to see. And that’s expected, we don’t limit our exhibits and permanent collections on view to a singular experience. So why does our content strategy come across as a string of limited individual experiences?</p>
<p>Next week is Tools of Change, part two of the winter NYC two-step, and from the schedule, it seems to be exploding with panels about ebooks, metadata, new business models, and discoverability. There are some timeslots where I have five panels circled. But before that, I just wanted to reiterate that Tools of Change is not particularly print-oriented. Print will be discussed, but only in the context of the larger question of content and audience and, let’s face it, it is quicker to reach audience digitally than through print. (<em>“Quicker, easier, more seductive.”</em>--Yoda. But I digress.)</p>
<p>That happens at too many of our institutions. We launch new avenues of content all the time but not enough of it, and without unity. We don’t make it easy for individual audience members to experience all of the content streams depending on where they are and what they are doing. Sam Ford, with MIT and Western Kentucky University, and author of the upcoming book Spreadable Media, has a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3005264/when-it-comes-content-strategy-its-better-think-about-spreadability-stickiness">great article in Fast Company</a> where he describes how over-reliance on established (aka, “safe,” “legacy,” “politically connected”) media channels often results in an all-or-nothing content approach--all too often ending in nothing. He suggests a variety of approaches to content strategy.</p>
<p>For us that means website with text and video and audio, working on desktops, tablets, and phones (with the latter optimized for institution visits since it’s the most likely device to be used in the galleries); Twitter (perhaps more than one feed, or with customized hashtags); Facebook; blogs; printed material including books, shorter texts, brochures; digital publications both long and short, with lots of links; a good public research database with lots of links. And so on. And all of it connected to each other.</p>
<p>Sounds complicated? So is ordering a pizza for six. Sounds like it can be done without a commitment at the highest levels of the institution to have all your content creators and producers on the same while also giving them the freedom to be creative? Right.</p>
<p>Another interesting article from the SEO side of things refers to <a href="http://searchengineland.com/why-you-need-to-treat-your-social-media-strategy-like-your-content-strategy-145199">treating social media strategy like content strategy</a>. An excellent point if we can start to see them all as aspects of the same thing. Same with audience. In the aggregate, they may want every possible content channel at the same exact point in time. Unless our print people are aligned with the technologists at #musesocial, we’re going to be wasting a lot of time and money reinforcing our silos. And when audiences see silos, they leave.</p>
<p>See you after Tools of Change. I’ll save some yummy desserts they serve during afternoon breaks.</p>

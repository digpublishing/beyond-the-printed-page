<p>I was surprised to see the article <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lincolnmichel/the-future-is-never#3136sqb">The Future of the Future of Books</a> by Lincoln Michel pop-up on a listserv this past week. There is usually snow on the ground and the New Year is usually right around the corner before we start seeing predictions about the future of books and digital publishing. And while much of it is pointed at the idea that print is not dead (yep, we all know and embrace that) and that comparing the advent of digital publishing cannot be compared to the advent of MP3s and iPods (many nice points), it is interesting that the predictions are partly distribution predictions (consumer bundling) and partly content focused, many of which museums are already grappling with such as adding more content to an ebook.  At one point, though, he states, “Art forms survive by figuring out what makes them unique, not by trying to emulate other mediums.” The sentence falls after dismissing enhanced digital publications as not “going anywhere” besides kids’ books and textbooks. Regardless of the content that surrounds it, this sentence has really made me think about digital publishing for art books.</p>
<p>Printed art books are set apart for their design, rich illustrations, and print quality.  And as a result, we tend to talk a lot about the challenges of producing digital art books which can have a hard time capturing those elements. Formats are restrictive. How do you create a publication to fit across all platforms ? Image rights are hard to obtain and are expensive. (I could keep going…) Part of producing digital books focused on art, though, is perhaps learning to let go of some of the traditional hallmarks of printed art books and embracing the uniqueness of the digital format and learning how to push the boundaries of whatever digital platform you are using in order to create a singular experience.</p>

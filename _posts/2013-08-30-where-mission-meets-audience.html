<p>We all talk about mission but no one does anything about it. As museum publishers we've all been used to the idea of making books because it's the right thing to do. Businesses who take a righteous approach go out of business really soon (or else they're Facebook, or else they become governments). They may form to meet a need, but to survive they need an audience.</p>
<p>Museum publishers have to address both the curatorial <em>mission </em>and the audience <em>need</em>. Even the most jaded museum publications department won't utterly ignore the reader, even for the most niche scholarly topic. (We wouldn't last very long at our institution telling curators, "no one will read your stupid book." How have <em>you</em> handled the starry-eyed curator proposing a splashy <em>New York Times</em> ad and launch for their book with a scheduled press run of 750?) Merchandising departments, obliged to take <em>some </em>copies of a book, do what they will, and so on, rinse and repeat. Museum stores have been under pressure regarding books for years, and we've all seen <em>tchotchkes </em>encroach on shelf space at once-dedicated bookstores like Barnes and Noble; is it any surprise that museum shops are doing the same? They're reacting to audiences.</p>
<p>And now, here comes digital. Museum publishers have long since put paid to the lie that digital is cheap to develop, because high scholarly standards aren't free. Still, there have been as many proposals for digital versions of printed content as there are digital formats: put some or all of the book on the museum's website, make an ebook, make an app <em>and </em>and ebook, distribute a PDF, or some combination of all of the above. The possibilities are infinite, and that's no way to run a railroad, or develop a business model.</p>
<p>And yet, the mission: maybe the curator is even gung-ho, maybe you have a digital department or a great freelance digital designer, or have employed a firm with a hip name like Box or Jell. (My apologies to any firm with said hip name.) You know exactly what it is you want to make to fulfill the museum's scholarly mission.</p>
<p>But have you thought of the other side of the equation: the audience? This is where many beautiful digital projects have floundered, not because they were badly executed or ill-conceived as content, but because they didn't understand how audiences interact with not just museum content but <em>digital content in general</em>. There have been some excellent discovery processes by museums, such as <a href="http://mw2013.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/design-thinking/">the one described by Dana Mitroff Silvers</a> at Museums and the Web's annual conference, about the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's upcoming three-year closure for renovation. Clearly we're thinking about visitors, hence the current vogue for "visitor experience," as encapsulated in terms such as "design thinking" and "experience design."</p>
<p>Digital publishing throws an interesting curve here, in that how we format our museums for a visiting audience isn't always the way that we format our content for a reading audience. Or, better said in the world of digital devices, a "using" audience, hence the term "user experience." The issue of how an art book can best be rendered on a digital device has bedeviled publishers for years, and I won't go into that question here but will sidestep it to say that from an audience's point of view it's all moot. Audiences behave in certain ways when consuming digital content, and museums sometimes lose sight of that in the creation process. You can't just create it and expect audiences to consume because audiences already have the devices and already use them in certain ways. The content has to fit into those behaviors, or else.</p>
<p>The prerogatives of mission can sometimes blur the need to reach an audience in ways that they are already accessing content. Print publishers need to be especially conscious of this, since the editorial development costs may be the same; the production of digital content may be less than printing an art book, but probably not as much less as we may think.</p>
<p>This will likely call for more than a little experimentation as we find the intersection between curatorial mission and audience comfort. That's all fine, but digital is a moving target, and we publishers may need to adjust our behavior in how we reach audiences with our formerly-print-only content. Ideally, we'll borrow from the visitor experience and experience design folks to make our digital content (and print content, too) a part of a mission-and-audience ecosystem. We publishers can't be the last ones in the building to worry about audience, and not just the guaranteed readers for our print books, but winning new audiences.</p>

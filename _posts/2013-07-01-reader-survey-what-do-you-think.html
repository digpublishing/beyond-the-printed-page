Over 19,000 views, 51 posts, and <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/04/24/the-bliki-wins-best-of-the-web/">one big award</a> later, we are pausing for some self-reflection on how the Bliki is best serving you and exploring the ever-expanding field of museum digital publishing.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x1cquxsydy7mpv_jxoqtMsY6QiISzllJGJOmE3VqLoU/viewform">Take a short survey here</a> and let us know what areas of the Bliki are working and which areas need some improvement.  Thanks in advance from the Bliki team!</p>

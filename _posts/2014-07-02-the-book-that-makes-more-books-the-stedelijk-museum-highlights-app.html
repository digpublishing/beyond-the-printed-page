<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>As part of the <a title="Off the Press: Electronic Publishing in the Arts" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/05/28/off-the-press-electronic-publishing-in-the-arts/">Off the Press</a> conference, Loes Sikkes, a designer at Medamo, presented a Digital Publishing Toolkit project she's currently collaborating on with nai010 publishers and PUNTPIXEL developers. The project (still in development) is a collections app for the Stedelijk Museum, stemming from two print publications—<em><a title="Highlights (nai010 publishers, 2012)" href="http://www.010.nl/catalogue/book.php?id=830" target="_blank">Highlights</a></em> and <em><a title="Reflections (nai010 publishers, 2012)" href="http://www.010.nl/catalogue/book.php?id=810" target="_blank">Reflections</a></em>—which offer respectively, a broad strokes overview and in-depth essays on the museum's collection.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this app is that it rather than just being a fixed publication, it actually <strong>functions as a publications platform for its readers</strong>. Within the app, users pick out what's most relevant and interesting to them, and then output that collected information as a single epub or pdf. In Sikkes' design sketches for the app, there's even a place where users can title and subtitle the book's cover, and pick out a color for it. As she says in her talk:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Our ambition was and is to develop a tool which allows the user to influence the composition of the content of their own digital publication. In that way the user can decide for himself how much information gets stored in his epub depending on the level of depth he desires."</em></p>
<p>Sikkes talks about the app as a tool for users' "personalizing and filtering", but I think the fact that they can also package and take away that collection (even if only digitally) is even more meaningful. I imagine this personal publication process will engage users with the content at a much deeper level than if they were reading a more traditional, static publication and merely skipping over the information that's not of personal  interest. Further, the app gives users more information about the artworks than they'll see in the app interface alone. Again from Sikkes' talk:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Beside basic information on artworks, extra information is offered. This could be, for example, scientific publication on the subject, an audio fragment, an interview with the artist, a lecture, or additional pictures belonging to this artwork as a starting point."</em></p>
<p>From what I gather, the app is still in the conceptual and developmental phase, but you can <a title="Video, My Highlights, Loes Sikkes" href="http://vimeo.com/96562365" target="_blank">watch the video</a> and <a title="Slides, My Highlights, Loes Sikkes" href="http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/S3_04_LoesSikkes.pdf" target="_blank">download the slides</a> from Sikkes presentation, or <a title="Blog, My Highlights, Loes Sikkes" href="http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/2014/05/loes-sikkes-highlights-epub-personalizer/" target="_blank">read a little more about it</a> on the Digital Publishing Toolkit blog.</p>

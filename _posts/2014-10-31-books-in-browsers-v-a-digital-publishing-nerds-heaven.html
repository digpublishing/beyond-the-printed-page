<p>Twenty-six talks lasting twenty minutes each spread over two days, <a href="http://booksinbrowsers.org" target="_blank">Books in Browsers</a> is scrappy, inspiring, humbling, exciting and exhausting. God, I love this conference.</p>
<p>I trolled the scrawls in my notebook for some highlights from this year's edition (held October 23–24, 2014, at the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco) to  share with our staff here at the Getty, and have further annotated them here. Read below, on <a href="www.slideshare.net/geealbers/bi-b14" target="_blank">SlideShare</a>, or <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BiB14.pdf" target="_blank">download the PDF</a>.</p>

<p>These were my main takeaways, and I think there are some important things in there to sink your mental teeth into, but I've still missed some fantastic material. The talks by <a title="YouTube" href="http://youtu.be/rhLRBrMZ66Y?list=PLhuFVlhLf9BnJpzkpPUwOSGD5ffNlThRB" target="_blank">James English &amp; Leonard Richardson</a>, from New York Public Library; <a title="YouTube" href="http://youtu.be/x5H98ielWck?list=PLhuFVlhLf9BnJpzkpPUwOSGD5ffNlThRB" target="_blank">Derrick Schultz</a>, from Atavist Books and Creatavist; and <a title="YouTube" href="http://youtu.be/61J3ZB6qmQg?list=PLhuFVlhLf9BnJpzkpPUwOSGD5ffNlThRB" target="_blank">Adam Hyde</a>, from PLOS come immediately to mind. And there are certainly even more. So read the notes, check out the <a title="BiB14 Playlist on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuFVlhLf9BnJpzkpPUwOSGD5ffNlThRB" target="_blank">videos</a>, and I'll see you in San Francisco next year for Books in Browsers VI!</p>

<p><em><strong>A number of disparate things that may be adding up:</strong></em></p>
<p>At the IDPF's Digital Book program at BEA at the end of May, Sanders Kleifeld, the director of publishing technology at O'Reilly Media, gave a talk on <a title="SlideShare: Open Source for Publishing" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sanderskleinfeld/open-source-forpubsslideshare" target="_blank">Open Source for Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>The call for proposals for Books in Browsers V is now open, and the theme for this year's conference is <a title="BiB14 call for proposals" href="http://booksinbrowsers.org/call-for-proposals/" target="_blank">Advancing Open Web Standards and Digital Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've come across a couple open, web-based art and museum publishing projects that I hope you'll be able to read more about here soon: The <a title="Online art books published by the Art Canada Institute" href="http://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/" target="_blank">online art books</a> of the Art Canada Institute; and a <a title="The current issue of Curious Quarterly" href="http://curious.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca" target="_blank">free digital magazine</a> called Curious Quarterly from the Royal BC Museum.</p>
<p>And of course there's the <a title="Off the Press: Electronic Publishing in the Arts" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/05/28/off-the-press-electronic-publishing-in-the-arts/" target="_blank">Off the Press conference</a> and Digital Publishing Toolkit project I posted about here previously.</p>
<p>For my part, I spoke at the National Museum Publishing Seminar in June on <a title="Web books NMPS talk on SlideShare" href="http://www.slideshare.net/geealbers/web-books-web-books-the-future-of-digital-publishing-is-open" target="_blank">web books and open publishing</a> as part of a panel that looked at digital publishing from EPUB to App. I'll also be moderating and speaking on a panel at the Museum Computer Network conference this fall in a session called <a title="Panel description on Google docs" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10RELPeG_iMX5EMz8fimoUhA1b52Zypa7N-0wyBrZE24/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Future of Digital Publishing is GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone else has been coming across other interesting open, digital publishing projects or tools lately—<a title="O'Reilly Atlas" href="https://atlas.oreilly.com" target="_blank">O'Reilly Atlas</a>, <a title="HPUB and the Baker Framework" href="http://www.bakerframework.com" target="_blank">HPUB</a>—I'd love to hear about them.

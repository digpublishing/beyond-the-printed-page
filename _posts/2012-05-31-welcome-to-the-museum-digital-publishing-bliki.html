<p style="text-align: left;">Digital publications are continuing to become a larger portion of the museum's overall publishing agenda. This 'bliki' aspires to be a resource to keep track of the evolving options and issues faced by museums and our publishing partners as we develop and execute our digital publishing strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What's a 'Bliki'?</strong><br />
For a digital publishing resource, we wanted features from both the blog and wiki worlds. The blog platform for its visual appeal and social media integration and the wiki to establish a resource of documentation and best practices. Beyond the Printed Page aspires to combine both the BLog and wIKI into the Bliki.</p>

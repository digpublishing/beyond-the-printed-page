<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">One of the many tensions museum publishers have to deal with is between the creative act of making content and the process of getting it into a (plat)form accessible to audiences. By content I mean the words, the interpretations, the scholarship generated by our curators. By process, I mean the infrastructure, both physical and digital, which makes the display of that content possible.</span></p>
<p>A changing world of publishing has recast the organizational lines so many times that it's hard to keep track nowadays of what's content and what's process. The content inherent in an 800-page book that a curator wanted is no longer dead on arrival,  because digital holds out possible routes to publish that content in various online formats. Powerful computers and widely-available desktop publishing and coding skills mean that production staff can work on content and curators can even publish. <a title="Steal This Dichotomy" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/06/26/steal-this-dichotomy-notes-from-the-national-museum-publishing-seminar-2012/" target="_blank">Dichotomies themselves have become passé</a>.</p>
<p>Or have they? Like improving telescopes revealing that the blurry nebulae in the night sky are actually untold numbers of galaxies, the apparent mingling of content and process has shown a larger structural conflict that speaks to a much greater struggle in the museum: culture. Digital capabilities haven't just changed what audiences expect, but what museum staffs expect when producing content and revising process.</p>
<p>The website ArtsFwd had a series of posts <a href="http://artsfwd.org/category/topics/culture/" target="_blank">exploring the culture in cultural organizations</a>, and if the discussion seems reminiscent of those HR seminars you might have taken on <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/" target="_blank">Myers Briggs personality styles</a> or <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/preferences/social_styles.htm" target="_blank">workplace personality quadrants</a>, why shouldn't it? If corporations can be people, why can't organizations have personalities?</p>
<p>The bigger issue is best discussed in the <a href="http://artsfwd.org/may-organizational-culture/" target="_blank">ArtsFwd post on embracing change</a>. Having attended both the <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/01/04/museum-computer-network-or-museum-content-network/" target="_blank">Museum Computer Network</a> and the <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/06/26/every-other-summer-somewhere-in-the-museum-publish-verse/" target="_blank">National Museum Publishing Seminar</a> in the past year, I was able to see the cultural difference between the experiment- and even failure-driven cultural digerati of MCN and the "how-do-we-get-from-books-to-there?" development of whatever publishing is going to turn into inherent in NMPS.</p>
<p>The experiment vs establishment dichotomy is more than just digital vs print. Every conversation about engaging audiences and improving visitor experience straddles a fault line about curatorial authority and competing narratives. Like any individual people, audiences are self-contradictory, wanting authority and accessibility, options but direction, community yet individuality, spontaneity and planning. Education departments, working closely with digital professionals, work hard to provide audiences with these possibilities. Curators, however, aren't so sure; at what point does access become pandering?</p>
<p>There's no litmus test, for instance, to determine if an object wall label is too watered down to be meaningful (though language professionals like the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jennifer-blunden/37/a21/b57" target="_blank">current Education fellow at the Metropolitan Museum are using semantic tools to try</a>). Same with book texts. Curators cringe over the covers for their books which publications departments insist are necessary for sales, meaning, engaging readers. Everyone in the museum talks about audience engagement, but no one is agreed on exactly what that term means. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>For museum publishers, this can be a dangerous time. Editorial departments have often been shielded from the dire economic realities of their mainstream-industry colleagues, but the rise of digital publishing--which has caused many wars in the for-profit publishing world--has called into question just what publishing actually means, or could mean. If digital publications may not appeal to the traditional art book audience, is the problem the digital platform, or the audience? Should audience behaviors be met on the terms of the audience, or of the museum (or its publishing arm)? Is social a way to bring the audience to the content, or the other way around? Can digital experimentation save a museum's soul, or sell it?</p>
<p>If I sound melodramatic, you've never seen curators throw down that they won't see their institution go down the path of digital pandering. Words like that don't easily shift to openness and democratization. Can publishers harness that curatorial passion <em>and</em> use digital techniques to reach out to audiences? Is there a new culture than can be forged from the worldviews represented by print and digital?</p>
<p>Damn, I hope so.</p>

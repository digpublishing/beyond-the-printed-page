<p>I'm thrilled to announce the launch of the <strong><a title="Getty Publications Virtual Library" href="http://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary" target="_blank">Getty Publications Virtual Library</a></strong>, an online repository of more than 250 titles from our archive that are now free to read online and to download. This library joins those of the <a title="MetPublications" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/metpublications" target="_blank">Met</a>, the <a title="Guggenheim Publications from the Archives" href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives" target="_blank">Guggenheim</a>, <a title="LACMA Reading Room" href="http://www.lacma.org/art/reading-room" target="_blank">LACMA</a> and others who have already made decades of scholarship available to the public at a scale and with an openness previously unimagined. And while from a digital publications standpoint these are simply facsimile scans in PDF form, they are a first step—for many of us I think—in making more of our books more widely available, and in ever more dynamic and meaningful ways.</p>

<p>This project started long before I came on board as the Getty's digital publications manager, and I played only a modest role in its final stages, but it is exactly this kind of thinking and these kinds of amazing books that attracted me to the job in the first place. Here at the Getty and at other art institutions, we have the opportunity to push digital publishing in the arts forward, and to explore how it might best serve us—not only as publishers, but as readers too. Enjoy!</p>

</a>The digital publishing platform start-up <a href="http://www.inkling.com/">Inkling</a> is being heralded for its ebook travel series by Frommer.  PC Magazine exclaims, "It's a shame the finished products are called 'e-books,' because that name doesn't really capture the fact that they are little works of art... an enticing blend of information and design that inspires exploration and curiosity."  Read reviews <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403982,00.asp">here</a> and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/04/30/BUDO1OB9J5.DTL&amp;type=tech">here</a>.</p>

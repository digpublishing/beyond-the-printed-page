<p>Tomorrow the <a href="http://www.mcn.edu">Museum Computer Network (MCN)</a> kicks off its 40th Annual  Conference in Seattle. Session topics cover a broad range of interests supporting this year's theme - <a href="http://www.mcn.edu/mcn-2012-annual-conference">The Museum Unbound: Shifting Perspectives, Evolving Spaces, Disruptive Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>
While many sessions may be of interest for followers of the Bliki, it's worth highlighting several sessions focused directly on digital publishing.</p>
<p>
Starting off the week Wednesday, Charlie Moad and his colleagues from the Indianapolis Museum of Art lead the workshop "<a href="http://mcn.edu/2012/digital-publishing-osci-toolkit">Digital Publishing with the OSCI Toolkit</a>." Participants will learn how to author online scholarly publications using tools developed as part of the Getty funded Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI).</p>
<p>
Thursday, Scott Sayre of Sandbox Studios, Kyle Jaebker of the IMA Lab and I will discuss planning and authoring for the Art Institute of Chicago's new LaunchPads. We'll talk about collaborative team-based authoring and curatorial, digital media and publication workflows. The session is "<a href="http://www.mcn.edu/2012/its-all-details-inner-workings-large-scale-media-project">It's All in the Details: The Inner Workings of a Large-Scale Media Project.</a>"</p>
<p>
Friday morning has been dubbed '<a href="http://www.mcn.edu/slack-day">Slack Day</a>', a morning where attendees can choose short technical mini-workshops, maker activities, or unconference sessions.  Sheila Brennan of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University is organizing an unconference session to explore building publications using feeds and plugins that would allow museums to collaborate with their communities on special topics by pulling in posts and contributions.</p>
<p>
Friday afternoon, the Seattle Art Museum presents "<a href="http://www.mcn.edu/2012/seattle-art-museum-online-scholarly-catalogue-chinese-painting-and-calligraphy">The Seattle Art Museum Online Scholarly Catalogue of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy</a>", which is part of the Getty's OSCI Initiative.</p>
<p>
Saturday also has its share of digital publishing starting with Bliki contributor and Hol Arts Books founder Greg Albers speaking in "<a href="http://www.mcn.edu/moving-forward-looking-sideways-creative-thinking-museum-digital-strategy">Moving Forward by Looking Sideways: Creative Thinking in Museum Digital Strategy</a>". In this session chaired by Sarah Hromack and Erica Gangsei, Greg will talk about the lessons he's learned as a business startup and digital publisher, and how museums might apply them to their own practices.</p>
<p>
Rachel Craft from the Indianapolis Museum of Art talks about her museum's agile and creative approach to publishing Saturday afternoon in a session called "<a href="http://www.mcn.edu/2012/agile-digital-publishing">Agile Digital Publishing</a>."</p>
<p>
The closing plenary is a participatory session chaired by Corey Timpson where we collectively document the main themes of the conference. With all the intriguing sessions occurring through the week, I am hopeful that we'll collect some interesting themes surrounding digital publishing in museums.</p>
<p>
Please leave a comment if I left something out! Hopefully I'll see some of you in Seattle.</p>

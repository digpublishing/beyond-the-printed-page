title: How I built this Site
---
Some things to include:

- Jekyll and static site generation
- Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters for baseline
- Typographic scale (modular scale)
- Git for version control
- GH Pages deployment
- Lack of complex build tools (yeoman, grunt, gulp, etc.) in favor of simple workflow.
- Fonts in use
- Optimization as part of design process
- _data for navigation?

Some comments:

- jQuery is a huge dependency; is it really needed?

Future things to add:

- Prose.io integration

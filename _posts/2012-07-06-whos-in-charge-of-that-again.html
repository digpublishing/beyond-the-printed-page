<p>Institutions with separate print and digital publishing operations may be struggling with something that has bedeviled any publishing arm of a not-for-profit for ages: the concept of ownership. It's <em>de rigueur</em> in the corporate world but can be dicey in nonprofits, especially museums, where the primacy of the institutional mission is used to justify all sorts of obstacles to the timely publication of whatever. How many of you have had a friend in mainstream publishing ask you, "Well, if the author (curator) is so late, why don't you just cancel the book, or tell them it's too late to make changes?" You may have rolled your eyes until you passed out.</p>
<p>If it seems like I was talking about deadlines and not ownership, I'd like to say that this is only a matter of semantics. <em>Someone</em> has to "own" the schedule if the publication is to stay on course. If your pubs department is small, that might always be the same person, but as your operation gets larger things can get squishier, especially in our neck of the woods. (If you don't have any such issues, then you're one of those perfect people about whom movies are never made.) I've found that almost any responsibility which isn't directly and obviously the province of one and only one person per project needs an owner.</p>
<p>These problems of ownership can increase exponentially when content becomes cross-platform. Let's say your print department and digital department are both interested about making great e-book X. Well, who's responsible, print or digital? Digital may have the tools and the technical moxie, but print may have the editors and the, uh, whatever moxie that would be. Of course, both have to be involved, but who is supposed to take charge? Both? Ha. Neither? Ha ha ha. Does your museum have an arms and armor collection for a fight to the death? Hey, it's nonprofit (though, as attributed to Wallace Stanley Sayre, "People are so vicious in academia because the stakes are so low.") and hyper-organization is for corporations. If we'd wanted a strict hierarchy we would have done this for a bank.</p>
<p>This is where all those buzzy terms like "managing without authority" can come in. Assuming that there's a team which gets responsibility for bringing forth said cross-platform digital content, every person on the team will need to own some part of the process. And, here's the kicker, someone will have to <em>own the concept of ownership</em>. This person's responsibility is to make sure that everyone knows what their roles are, and to keep an eye out for anything running off the rails, or for the same person avoiding answering a question three times. That's a thankless task, usually best done by someone with some project management experience (also known as a track record of having completed something, anything). Interns with masochistic streaks can qualify, but someone senior will have to guide them through the political maze that often lurks inside our museums.</p>
<p>Ownership can sound like a drag but it's the only way to stop from going insane on publishing content streams where there's the least question of responsibility. And even if it seems like an easy issue, it's a best practice worth practicing.</p>

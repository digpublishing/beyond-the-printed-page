<p><em>I often write emails answering digital publishing questions and offering advice. And almost as often, I think I should just copy the email right onto the blog and share it with everyone. So, today I did.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">Hi ______,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">Good seeing you at <a title="Museum Computer Network" href="http://mcn.edu/" target="_blank">MCN</a> and I'm glad we got a chance to chat a little. I thought of one other tool that would be worth looking into. It's called <a title="in5 website" href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/" target="_blank">in5</a> and is an extension for InDesign that lets you export directly to HTML5, and it uses the same InDesign interactivity tools you would use to create a DPS publication. With the HTML5 export, you can post to the web, and, with the additional use of an open source tool called <a title="Baker Framework" href="http://www.bakerframework.com/" target="_blank">Baker</a>, you can easily convert from HTML5 into a DPS-like app for iOS and Android.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">There is a cost for the tool, but it's modest. The creator of in5, Justin Putney, has <a title="10 Reasons Why You Should be Thinking About HTML for Digital Publications and How to Get Started" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2014/08/14/html-for-digital-publications/">written for the blog here</a>. HeÂ is a very nice guy and could probably be hired to help on your publication if you'd want technical assistance. Or would certainly be able to point you to someone with experience using the tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">Also, <a title="Adobe's DPS announcement" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/e-publishing-evolved/" target="_blank">Adobe announced today</a> they are discontinuing their Single Edition DPS offering. Which would mean were you to go with DPS, you'd have to sign up as a Pro or Enterprise user, which is really geared to making multiple DPS apps, and comes with potentially significant monthly and per-project costs. Adobe's replacement for individual projects previously best suited for Single Edition is to suggest Fixed Layout EPUB (which InDesign can now export to), but honestly, to me those aren't much more than glorified PDFs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">Best,<br />
Greg</span></p>

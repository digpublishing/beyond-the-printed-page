<p>The National Museum Publishing Seminar occurred in Chicago June  21-23.  The conference was full of ideas surrounding print and digital content, business and design strategies. Over the next few weeks, the Bliki will feature follow up commentary  and link to some of the resources discussed by panelists at the seminar.  If you have ideas or resources, please don't hesitate to write a blog post or edit the wikis!</p>

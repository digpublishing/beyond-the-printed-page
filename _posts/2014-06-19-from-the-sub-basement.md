At this year’s National Museum Publishing Seminar, I moderated and spoke on a panel on digital publishing. Joining me were e-book production artist Tina Henderson, whose current obsession is “dual-orientation multi-touch ibooks”; Elisa Leshowitz, who works with a terrific roster of client publishers and oversees the growing e-book program for ARTBOOK | D.A.P.; and Edyta Lewicka of Potion design who, with Yale University Press and the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation produced the amazing Interaction of Color app released with much acclaim last year.

We were given the Imperial Ballroom at the Boston Park Plaza hotel (pictured above), which was certainly the largest and grandest space in which I’ve ever spoken about digital publishing. Much more typical have been small rooms, in obscure hallways, in front of a crowd of a couple dozen, rather than the maybe hundred and fifty people we had in attendance in Boston. A good sign for the state of digital publishing in museums!

Then again, the title of our session was “Digital Publishing 101″. How (you might ask) could we be in such a grand space and yet still talking about such mundane and basic topics? How have we not progressed past the 101 stage in the seven years since the first Kindle, and four since the first iPad? I think, however, that the juxtaposition between the grandness and size of the space and the very introductory nature of our panel sums up the state of museum digital publishing perfectly: We’re really interested in digital publishing and we know what an important role it should play in our work, but we still have no idea what we’re really going to do to make it happen. Our task then was to give attendees some tools to that end.

Sessions on digital publishing tend toward the hyper-specific—practical talks about single projects using single platforms or formats—or the hyper-theoretical—inspiring oratories about the grand digital possibilities before us. What we don’t see often if at all is a practical overview of all the choices before us. So that’s what we aimed for in our session, subtitled “The Complete Picture from EPUB to App”. Elisa covered reflowable e-books; Tina talked about fixed layout and the e-book/app hybrid formats produced with iBooks Author and Adobe DPS; Edyta talked about custom apps; and I rounded out the group with web books. It was tight and a lot to get through, but somehow we covered the complete range of digital publishing options that museum digital publishers are using now, or might want to use in the future. Not bad for 75 minutes work.

We also created a handy chart breaking it all down as best we could. Well, it’s probably more overwhelming than handy at first, but hopefully it will ultimately prove useful. The whole thing is available to read and comment on at http://bit.ly/digpub101. Enjoy!

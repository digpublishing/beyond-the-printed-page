<p>In "<a href="http://toc.oreilly.com/2013/03/mobile-native-publishing-the-rise-of-dynamic-content-services.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+oreilly%2Fnews+(O'Reilly+News+and+Commentary)">Mobile Native Publishing: The Rise of Dynamic Content Services</a>," Mark Sigal draws the parallel between the disruption that the "talkie" created in the film industry in the 1920s to the recent introduction of the ebook in the publishing sector.  This very apt analogy is teased out to show what the publishing industry can learn from the film industry's adaptation to a new technology some 90 years ago.  Sigal writes, "The talkie not only changed how movies were made and the economics of the business itself, but critically, it changed our concept of what a movie could be."   And as a result, learning to create content for the new medium --writing for a movie with sound/writing and designing for a multimedia screen layout as opposed to a page layout--is of utmost importance.  Sigal writes, "The talkie wasn’t destined to become silent film with words, so too it follows that in the age of smartphones and tablets, publishing will evolve to become much more than a simple carbon copy of print. Every medium, after all, has its own set of native methods, and these methods, in turn, shape the medium."  To find out more about what this concretely means for the publishing industry, data, and content creation, read Sigal's article <a href="http://toc.oreilly.com/2013/03/mobile-native-publishing-the-rise-of-dynamic-content-services.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+oreilly%2Fnews+(O'Reilly+News+and+Commentary)">here at Tools of Change</a><a href="http://toc.oreilly.com/2013/03/mobile-native-publishing-the-rise-of-dynamic-content-services.htm">.</a></p>

<p>The Kress Foundation has sponsored a thorough report on the state of digital art history and how it relates to traditional art history research centers. Cultural heritage consultant Diane Zorich undertook the survey and authored an the report, <em><a title="Kress Foundation" href="http://www.kressfoundation.org/news/Article.aspx?id=35338" target="_blank">Transitioning to a Digital World: Art History, Its Research Centers, and Digital Scholarship</a></em>, which is now available from the Kress Foundation web site. For the study, Kress also partnered with leaders in the field of digital humanities at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University.</p>
<p>This meaty report of 69 pages covers the current usage of digital resources and tools in art history scholarship and publication, barriers to adoption of digital methods and potential solutions to getting past these barriers. It also contains a useful list of digital art history projects.</p>

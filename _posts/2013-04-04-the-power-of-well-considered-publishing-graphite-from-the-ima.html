<p>Regular readers know <a title="If you insist on publishing with Adobe DPS or iBooks Author …" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2013/02/22/if-you-insist-on-publishing-with-adobe-dps-or-ibooks-author/" target="_blank">I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to iBooks Author</a>, and yes this is another iBooks Author post, but guess what? It's positive! <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Indianapolis Museum of Art has just released its first all-digital exhibition catalogue for the current show, </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" title="&quot;Graphite&quot; at the IMA" href="http://www.imamuseum.org/exhibition/graphite" target="_blank"><em>Graphite</em></a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> (December 7, 2012–June 2, 2103). It's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/graphite/id630625834" target="_blank">available through iTunes</a> for $4.99 and was published with iBooks Author. Three features of the book immediately caught my eye as worth sharing and, for those of you undertaking your own iBA projects, worth emulating.</span></p>
<p><strong>#1:</strong> Following is a screen shot from the Artists section of the book. See the navigation links at the top? There’s one for each of the four main sections of the book and they run along the top of most of the book’s pages. This isn’t a feature of iBooks Author, it’s something the IMA team designed to address iBA’s inherently tricky internal navigation tools, and to facilitate a looser and more seamless jumping around reading experience for the reader. Smart. Even better? See the name and progress bar graphic in the upper right? That’s another IMA add-on and it tracks where you are in each section. Super smart.</p>

<p><strong>#2:</strong> Next, a screen shot from the Exhibition Tour section. Yes, that's right. The catalogue to the show includes installation shots of the show itself. Art historians out there immediately understand how valuable this is, but even for regular readers, how great is it to visit an exhibition you love and buy the book to then have it include a record of your actual experience of the show? Pretty great. And, because the catalogue's digital, this can be achieved while still having the publication available for sale during the run of the exhibition.  In this case, the IMA got it out about four months after the opening date, but I think significantly less is perfectly possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0263.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2724" title="IMG_0263" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/IMG_0263.png" alt="Screen shot of the Exhibition Tour section" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#3:</strong> The final thing I want to point out is video. We all know that video can be inserted into e-books, and many art publishers have taken advantage of this to include artist interviews and other "enhanced" features. In the introductory essay to <em>Graphite</em> though, the IMA includes the full video of artist Richard Serra's 3-minute film, <em>Hand Catching Lead</em>, 1968. I first saw the work a couple of years ago at SFMOMA in the big Serra retrospective there. To come across it again, in its entirety, in the palm of my hand, was fantastic. For me as a reader, this is of real value. I'm amazed not to have seen artist video works included like this before. And for all the Rights &amp; Reproductions nuts out there, note that this video piece was cleared with Artists Rights Society and comes from MOMA, so yes, it's possible.</p>

<p>So, to the team at the IMA that made this all possible—especially Director of Publishing and Media, <a href="http://rachelcraft.com/" target="_blank">Rachel Craft</a>—congratulations! You brought hope to this young curmudgeon's heart. Unfortunately, for our readers, there's bad news here as well. The IMA recently came under new directorship and the institution's commitment to cutting-edge digital publishing (among other things) has shifted away. Rachel and many others were laid off last month and it seems as though this first great <a title="#digpublishing on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digpublishing" target="_blank">#digpublishing</a> effort from the museum will likely be their last. That's a shame, but perhaps the rest of us will take to heart, and to code, their terrific effort.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATES, May 23, 2013:</strong></p>
<p>• Rachel reminded me to give a well-deserved shout out to Jay David at <a href="http://toky.com/">TOKY Branding + Design</a> who was a major collaborator on some of the unique elements I pointed out in <em>Graphite</em>'s design. Shout!</p>
<p>• Apparently, negotiating the rights for the Serra video took <strong>6 months</strong>. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/AYoungRandR">@AYoungRandR</a>!</p>
<p>• You can now get more of the inside scoop on <em>Graphite</em>'s development in this talk from the 2012 Museum Computer Network conference in Seattle, now available on YouTube: <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIAkSKsmZzs">Agile Digital Publishing</a></em> with Rachel Craft, Jay David and the IMA Lab's Kyle Jaebker.</p>

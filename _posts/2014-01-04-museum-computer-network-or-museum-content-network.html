<p>I made the joke many times in the lead-up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp67HS3m_Pg">my presentation at the Museum Computer Network annual conference in Montreal</a> that, coming from a print background, I was a caveman (complete with image from classic Phil Hartman <a href="http://snuh.tumblr.com/post/4681288883/phil-hartman-as-keyrock-unfrozen-caveman-lawyer">Saturday Night Live sketch</a>). I expected to be living Future Shock for three days, aswim in acronyms.</p>
<p>I was wrong—not because I was unfamiliar with the terminology, which I was to a degree, but because the museum computing community is warm, welcoming, and, most of all, open. Open access, open minded, open to experimentation, open to audiences. (“When you're experimenting, there are always people who want to help you,” as one speaker said.) And best of all for my part of the world, open to print …</p>
<p>But there I go again, getting my print-digital dichotomy on. The techie vs old-school antagonism is overblown. Even calling the group the Museum Computer Network is anachronistic. To borrow the corporate buzzy term of the moment, this is a conference about museum <i>Content</i>, in all its forms, and if that doesn’t include print, it’s because print isn’t asking (demanding?) to be included. Considering that the preparation of a printed catalogue is now 99 percent digital, that’s at best silly, at worst inefficient and wasteful of finite museum resources.</p>
<p>The issue here isn’t the container—platforms come and go, and if you think you know what visitor experience will look like in five years you’re lying or else in possession of dangerous time-travel technology—but the <i>connections </i>that museums undertake, and I mean internally. My own brainstorming about content flow showed that there are tons of ways that museum departments currently reach the outside world, and a lot fewer ways that they reach each other. That’s the real openness challenge.</p>
<p>Technology itself is a descriptive term, a symptom of civilization, not its driving force. Hence <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dhegley&amp;ei=GEuiUuXBOfPlsASZgIKwBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTNe8DUJ8hzrQRIQGx4sVJBeTRRw&amp;sig2=QDv3VaCXFegacflwrjhzaw&amp;bvm=bv.57752919,d.cWc">Douglas Hegley</a>’s talk, “WTF: Technology,” during the first evening’s slate of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUKZ86F9i4">ignite talks</a>. He noted that the only changes worth making are those that impact people, not devices. Know your audiences, not technology, as per the panel “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQXEEEz7Tyw">Beyond the Visitor Survey: Using Research to Drive Design Decisions</a>.” We need to align our personal values with our work values (with our institutional mission, my addition), as per the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLjy1fhCJE">MCN keynote</a> from <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/about/hi-i-am-tina">Tina Roth Eisenberg</a> of Brooklyn-based creative endeavors Tattly and others. We need to always be experimenting, prototyping, iterating, and collaborating, as <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com">Beyond the Printed Page</a>'s own Liz Neely of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Micah Walter of the Cooper-Hewitt, so ably demonstrated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677eGxccxLY">their talk on rapid prototyping in the museum</a>.</p>
<p>Museums have done an admirable job inculcating forward-thinking departments within their walls, but maybe not as effectively connecting them to other departments in order to create a culture of experimentation. Or, as <a href="https://twitter.com/cb_sexton">Charlotte Sexton</a>, recently of the National Gallery, London, said, “there's a difference between being ‘risk aware’ and ‘risk averse’.”</p>
<p>It’s the internal risks that we have to take, the internal pitches we have to have ready, as Micah Walter said. Those are the risks that require that we step outside of our job descriptions, that we make extra work for ourselves beyond the deadlines we already have. Those are the demands we need to start making: for our HR departments to hire the right kind of people, for the content-oriented conferences to make space for non-profits, for the museum-oriented conferences to make room for content specialists and publishers. Sometimes we have to be a little bit rogue within our own buildings, as <a href="https://twitter.com/kristhayer11">Kris Thayer</a>, at the <a href="http://new.artsmia.org/">Minneapolis Institute of Arts</a>, said during her presentation with Douglas Hegley, on using Adobe’s Digital Publishing Suite for a new line of digital publications. (How’s that for a report to your boss? “What was your takeaway from the conference that we paid to send you to?” “That we have to GO ROGUE!”)</p>
<p>It’s overkill to call any conference transformative, but I know that my own sense of my place—and print’s place—within in the current museum content landscape changed over the course of MCN. I only had to listen to myself at the “Speed-date Networking” event the second morning of the conference. At the first couple of tables I was telling other attendees that I had come to bring print departments closer to their digital colleagues; by the third table, I was going to bring both print and digital closer together; by the sixth or seventh pitch, I was going to bring all museum departments together into a larger content universe. That’s the prize we in museums should be aiming for. The old antagonisms of print vs digital have given way to the new relationship between curatorial and “interpretorial,” to use a great term I heard from Cleveland Museum of Art’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEEQFjAD&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Jennifer_Foley&amp;ei=bUaiUtSUIezlsATUsYLACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwzMZ8AEGM-H4FIgJZylWkKu70ZA&amp;sig2=VNjFHqwJYbKDRLJ4VdIpiQ&amp;bvm=bv.57752919,d.cWc">Jennifer Foley</a> during “Working Across Boundaries,” which featured a curator discussing in real time the positives and negatives of the Gallery One project from a curatorial point of view.</p>
<p>We need to push together to compete for our potential visitors’ attention spans against the Xboxes of the world. We have to evaluate our internal processes, asking questions with real answers and real action plans, as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CE4QFjAI&amp;url=https://twitter.com/exposyourmuseum&amp;ei=nUWiUoWcCK3lsAS25YHACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHf7u4WZcZT4ygz8eiyVv0P7Ops_Q&amp;sig2=0Pis2zgyD4lm3wuTnQa8Bw&amp;bvm=bv.57752919,d.cWc">Kate Tinworth</a> of <a href="//23500A4C-7034-47EE-B678-E873B00DF1AD/word/exposeyourmuseum.com">Expose Your Museum</a> said during her presentation on improving internal evaluations.</p>
<p>I write all this in the full knowledge than many institutions have done all of the above. The Met has done some of it, and can do better. But we as a community have to have these priorities or we’re not going to gain the synergies our corporate counterparts have gained (at no small cost in jobs and tension, I add, but that’s the nonprofit-sector horse we all rode in on).</p>
<p>I said about 18 months ago when I first started blogging on this Bliki that I wanted to <a href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/2012/06/26/steal-this-dichotomy-notes-from-the-national-museum-publishing-seminar-2012/">get past dichotomies</a>. Not to get all Buddhist/Matrix-y, but there is no dichotomy. It’s all the same museum content world, and we continue to think of ourselves in opposition to other interpreters to our peril.</p>

<h3><strong>Blog</strong></h3>
<p>Blog posts can be a mention or re-blog of something relevant and interesting to the museum publishing field or it can be a feature article about a provoking topic or project.  It probably should be fewer than 1,000 words and illustrations always make something more interesting. The Blog uses a software called Wordpress.  If you don't understand how to use the software, Google "How to use Wordpress" or something like that.</p>
<p>When you submit a post, it goes to the moderators for review. You will be notified by email when the post is published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Wiki</strong></h3>
<p>Wikis give us an open and collaborative authoring tool to build a body of documentation. Unlike a blog post, a wiki is expected to change and evolve. Wiki changes are made without moderation. If you see abuse happening in a wiki, please add a comment bringing it to the attention to the moderators.</p>
<p>Above all, please be polite and respectful of your collaborators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Promote Your Bliki Contribution</strong></h3>
<p>Word of mouth is great, and word of Internet is even better. May we suggest you share your contribution on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or whereever your network may be. If you promote a contribution from the Bliki on Twitter, cc/ the blog's account <a title="@pubsbliki on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/pubsbliki/" target="_blank">@pubsbliki</a>.  If you are tweeting generally about digital publishing, use the hashtag <a title="#digpublishing on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23digpublishing" target="_blank">#digpublishing</a>. (So, if you are promoting a Bliki post about <a title="#digpublishing on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search/%23digpublishing" target="_blank">#digpublishing</a>...it might have both.)</p>
<p>We have some <a title="Terms &amp; Acceptable Use" href="http://digitalpublishingbliki.com/about/terms-acceptable-use/">Terms and Acceptable Use Guidelines</a>.</p>

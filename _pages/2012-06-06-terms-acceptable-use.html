<p>The mission of the Museum Digital Publishing Bliki is to serve as a collaboratively authored resource for the museum community.  Although attempts will be made to be as open and collaborative as possible, the moderators reserve the right to modify submitted content and to not publish submitted content.  The moderators may also find the need to remove published content and to disable registered accounts at their sole discretion.</p>
<p>The Bliki is an information resource and not a space to advertise sales of goods and services. All contributors are expected to act respectful and abide by authoring guidelines. Views expressed on the Bliki are of the individual contributor and not necessarily that of his/her institution or any other collaborating institution.</p>

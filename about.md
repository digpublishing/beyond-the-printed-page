<h3><strong>Welcome to the Museum Digital Publishing Bliki!</strong></h3>
<p>Digital publications have become a larger part of our overall publishing agenda, whether digitizing backlists to creating new eBooks and online catalogues. Within this newly evolving field, though, the sheer range of options for publishing platforms, vendor arrangements and business models can be dizzying. This ‘bliki’ aspires to be a resource to keep track of the evolving options and issues faced by museums and our publishing partners as we develop and execute our digital publishing strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What's a 'Bliki'?</strong><br />
For a digital publishing resource, we wanted features from both the blog and wiki worlds. The blog platform for its visual appeal and social media integration and the wiki to establish a resource of documentation and best practices much like is available for mobile on the <a title="MuseumMobile Wiki" href="http://wiki.museummobile.info/" target="_blank">Museum Mobile Wiki</a>. Beyond the Printed Page aspires to combine both the BLog and wIKI into the Bliki.</p>
<p><strong>How do I use the Bliki?</strong><br />
<strong></strong>Within the blog, read the posts and then join the conversation by leaving your own opinion in the form of a comment below the blog post.  Have your own idea about a great article?  Leave a comment or register as a contributor.</p>
<p>If you need inspiration or to see how other institutions are facing the challenges of digital publishing, go to the wiki pages to discover conference presentations and papers, more thought-provoking blog posts as well as scholarly publications.  We need your help, though, in gathering all of the resources.  Select the edit button and type the useful information, resources, and digital publication projects that you know!</p>
<p>And don't forget: if you like something, let the world know through the social sharing buttons!</p>

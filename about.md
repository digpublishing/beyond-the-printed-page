##Welcome to the Museum Digital Publishing Bliki

Digital publications have become a larger part of our overall publishing agenda, whether digitizing backlists to creating new eBooks and online catalogues. Within this newly evolving field, though, the sheer range of options for publishing platforms, vendor arrangements and business models can be dizzying. This _‘bliki’_ aspires to be a resource to keep track of the evolving options and issues faced by museums and our publishing partners as we develop and execute our digital publishing strategies. This is a test editing in text edit. 

>For a digital publishing resource, we wanted features from both the blog and wiki worlds.

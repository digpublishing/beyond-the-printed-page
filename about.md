Welcome to _Beyond the Printed Page_, a showcase of the ideas, skills, projects and people shaping digital publishing in art and museums today.

###History

In April 2012, in the thick of the [Online Scholarly Cataloguing Initiative](http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/osci/), and following conversations at that year’s [Museums and the Web](http://www.museumsandtheweb.com) conference, this site first launched at its original home, digitalpublishingbliki.com. Titled _Beyond the Printed Page_, but affectionately referred to as the Bliki (part blog, part wiki) the site aimed to “be a resource to keep track of the evolving options and issues faced by museums and our publishing partners as we develop and execute our digital publishing strategies”. Moderated by Amy Weber Parkolap and Liz Neely of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Bliki was (and still is) one of the few places conversations and community converge around the topic of digital publishing in the arts. Three years, a dozen authors, and seven dozen posts later we thought it was time for a refresh. 

###The Future

In this new incarnation of _Beyond the Printed Page_ we are switching from a weekly blog format to something more like an online magazine. The plan is to publish periodic issues with several articles at once, perhaps under a central theme. We hope this is a more realistic editorial schedule for our team, attracts and motivates new contributors, and offers a more dynamic and satisfying experience for our readers.

While the wiki part of the Bliki long ago fell into disrepair and was subsequently removed from the site, there has remained a need for, and interest in, cataloging the many digital projects museums and other art publishers now produce. Not only to know what’s out there, but also to know how it was done and what tools were used to do it. This site’s [Digital Publications Directory]({{site.baseurl}}/directory) is a first stab at that. 

Finally, the open source technology driving the new BTPP promises to offer exciting new possibilities for experimentation and play. We hope the site itself becomes an proving ground for what the future of digital publishing might look like.
